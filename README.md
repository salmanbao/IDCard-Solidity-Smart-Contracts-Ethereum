# IDCard Project

IDCard is an anonymous on-chain news and social networking service based on the Ethereum network. You can easily post your moments and articles, create digital assets, or engage in DApp development on blockchain through IDCard. All your activities and information related to your account (personal reputation, copyrights, following & follower history, etc.) will be recorded permanently on the blockchain. Currently, IDCard has developed applications based on the Ethereum smart contract, such as “on-chain” email system, reputation-motivative contract. Eventually, it aims at deriving a decentralized ecosystem from social platform. 

The IDCard team aims to provide a high-quality media platform where contents can be stored securely. Moreover, starting as a social network, IDCard will provide next-generation copyright protection, on-chain IoT, and development interface for DApp on the blockchain. As long as you have an Ethereum wallet, you can use your own IDCard to build up your personal ‘on-chain’ social image. Particularly, the IDCard project provides API for all the DApps when the developers would like identified ‘on-chain’ users to enjoy their amazing products. We are willing to share any great Ethereum DApps within our platform to boost the development of the on-chain application ecosystem.
